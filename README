1. INSTALLING
    The base directory the scripts and templates expect to use is
    /usr/lib/cgi-bin/tdtds although the scripts can be changed by
    editing a single setting in a single file (Tdtds/Common.pm).  

    The scripts depend on a Tdtds subdirectory
    (e.g. /usr/lib/cgi-bin/tdtds/Tdtds) and a templates subdirectory
    (e.g. /usr/lib/cgi-bin/tdtds/templates) although this too can be
    changed by editing Common.pm

    The default login page for the site is currently at
    /var/www/tdtds/index.html, but nothing depends on that location
    and it could be at /whocares/Timbuktu without issues.
    The stylesheet is at /var/www/tdtds/css/default.css and changing that
    requires another edit to Common.pm.

2. TEMPLATE NOTES

    $current_title controls what generate_header uses as the browser title
    (that is the title that typically appears on the browser's title bar,
    rather than as part of the page).

    $current_template is the name of the file to use as the body of the page,
    with some substitutions (as used by generate_page and
    generate_entry_error_page).

    <!-- tdtds_heading --> is replaced by the value of $current_title in both
    the header template and the body template.

    <!-- tdtds_error_in_form --> is replaced by the error message for data
    entry forms (e.g. registration form), in the body template.

    <!-- tdtds_login_error --> is replaced by the error message for data 
    entry forms (e.g. login page), in the body template.

    <!-- tdtds_current_vote_table --> is replaced by a table of numbers of
    votes for each approved song+artist

3.  ACTIONS

    Current script 'actions' (action=xxx) are:
        login
        register
        confirm
        reset_password
	cast_vote
	remove_vote
	add_url
	logout
	home
	

4.  DEPENDENCIES

    Tested with Perl 5.8.4, should work with 5.6 as well.

    In addition to core Perl modules, requires Test::Warn, Data::UUID,
    and URI::Escape.  Under Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 (Sarge) these are
    provided by libtest-warn-perl, libossp-uuid-perl, and liburi-perl
    respectively.
